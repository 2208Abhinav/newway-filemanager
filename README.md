Newway is a file manager both for servers and for linux distros. Currently, it can perform the functions mentioned in the list above. For added security, this project implements the [jls-login system](https://github.com/naveen17797/jsonLogSys).

## Installation
Newway uses the prescence of the `jls-login.json` file to detect if a user has been created/registered. To create a user, delete the existing `jls-login.json` file from
the home directory and revisit the url again e.g `localhost/newway` if you have placed it in xampp's htdocs folder.
